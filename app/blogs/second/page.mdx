# how to add git in local project

Adding Git to a local project turns your folder into a Git repository, allowing you to track changes, commit code, and push to remote repositories (like GitHub, GitLab, etc.).

## ✅ Step-by-Step Guide: Add Git to a Local Project

👉 Let’s say you have a project folder called web-development.

## ✅ Step 1: Open Git Bash in the Project Folder

open vs-code terminal and move into project folder (web-development).

## ✅ Step 2: Initialize the Git Repository

```
git init
```

👉 🔸 This creates a hidden .git folder and turns your project into a Git repository.

## ✅ Step 3: Add Files to Staging

To track all files in the project folder:

```
git add .
```

The dot (.) means “add everything in this folder.”

## ✅ Step 4: Commit the Changes

```
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

✅ This creates your first snapshot of the project.

### ✅ Step 5: (Optional) Link to a Remote Repository (e.g., GitHub)

If you’ve already created a GitHub repo:

```
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
```

### 👉 Then push the code:

```
git push -u origin main
```

### ⚠️ If you’re using a older Git version, use master instead of main:
